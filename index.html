        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration Managementüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Brandon Yu and I am currently a sophomore attending University of California, Riverside. I was born in San Francisco, California which is located in Northern California. At University of California, Riverside, I am pursuing my Bachelors in Business Administration with a concentration in Management. I want to pursue management because growing up, my father owned his own business in which he is the manager, this lead me to find interest in learning to run my own business in the future.<br><br> 

Growing up, I mainly had an interest in computers starting from a young age of 12, where I built my first computer and I was hooked. Throughout my years in middle school and high school my love for computers has only grown and developed. While applying for colleges I highly considered majoring in computers, but after a lot of thoughts I decided that my interest in computers could benefit me if I ran my own business. Although I am not pursuing a major in computers, I still hope to have computer based work surround my career. <br><br>

I have many different hobbies that I enjoy doing throughout by free time in the week. One of the biggest hobbies of mine is rock climbing! I first discovered rock climbing my freshman year of high school and have since then gone hundreds of times. I have even purchased my own rock climbing shoes and gear in order to go anytime I please. One of the other hobbies of mine is to skateboard all the time. This was also a hobby that I first discovered my freshman year of college. Initially, I only rode my Penny board but since then I have exclusively ridden my electric skateboard known as a Boosted Board. This board is more than just a hobby considering it is a form of transportation to me. 
I can ride at a top speed of 24 miles per hour which means I will never be late to class again! <br><br>

I plan on living with a handful of my best friends throughout the rest of my college life. In the house, I try my best to save money by cooking every week and by meal prepping like crazy! I cook everything that ranges from chicken to chicken. Sadly, being in college means you can‚Äôt eat ‚Äúbougie‚Äù all the time and have to buy some cheap whack foods like chicken from Stater Bros. Although, when I do decide to go out and eat I usually go eat at Raising Cane‚Äôs with my buddies. Clearly you can see that I enjoy consuming mass amounts of chicken. <br><br>

Living in the college life has been quite an experience, and I look forward to every single day I get to spend with my friends. More importantly, I am focusing on school to ensure I can graduate with good grades and great knowledge in my field to be able to successfully run my own business. With such a healthy mix of study and fun, I think I am quite privileged to have this great opportunity.<br>
